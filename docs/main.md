## What is the Scientific Method?

### Writing Style

- Structure should not follow the timeline research, but the semantic structure of the discovery
- No rhetorical questions
- No judgmental formulations
- Sentences should be able to stand on their own; reference people and things by their name, not implicit references
- Do not use the present tense when referring to past events, even if it is popular in journalism
- Do not use metaphors which are highly imprecise, even if they are common among technical people
- "I" should not be used in texts
- Summaries should be about the effect of the research on the subject, not the author's view on the subject
- The "motivation" at the start of the paper should not be the personal factors, but prior pointers

### Typical Criteria

- Complexity of the theme
- Amount of personal research
- Quality of the content
- Depth of research
- Selection of sources
- Implementation of prior knowledge
- Structure of the paper
- Visual style (used fonts, formatting etc.)
- Quote style (standardized quotes)
